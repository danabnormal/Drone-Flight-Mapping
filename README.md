# Drone-Flight-Mapping

## Introduction
This is a tutorial for creating offline maps specifically related to drone flight planning. A few points:
* This assumes Windows 10 and all instructions are based on this, other platforms may act slightly differently.
* I am a Mavic Air 2 pilot in the UK and distances etc are based on my restrictions for example use only and should be adjusted according to your specific local regulations.
* **Use these instructions at your own risk** - this is for informational purposes only and nothing in this implementation, nor its output, should be taken as authorization to fly in any specific area. This is simply a tool to *assist you in the decisions you make and are responsible for*. 
* This process uses Open Source software which will need to be installed on your machine.

## Step One - install and configuring QGIS
QGIS is an open source mapping tool which will the bulk of this process will be done in. There may be some steps which offer little explanation - this is on purpose. QGIS can be a bit daunting purely due to its complexity so I've tried to keep this complexity out of this document. Where feasible I'll include links to appropriate documentation should you want to read more about certain aspects.


* Download the latest version of QGIS from the [QGIS website](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) (this tutorial is based off of version 3.16).
* Install the application with default settings throughout the installer.
